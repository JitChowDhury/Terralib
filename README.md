# Raylib Terraria Clone

A learning-focused Terraria-style 2D sandbox game built using **C++** and **raylib**.
This project is aimed at understanding low-level game systems by implementing
everything from scratch without an engine.

## Goals

- Tile-based world generation
- Block placement and destruction
- Player movement and physics
- Simple inventory system
- Chunk-based world loading (later)
- Basic enemies and combat

This is **not a full Terraria clone**, but a technical and educational project
to explore how such systems work internally.

## Tech Stack

- Language: C++17
- Graphics / Input: raylib
- Build System: CMake
- Platform: Windows (MSVC), extensible to Linux

## Current Status

🚧 Early development — core systems in progress.

## Why this project?

Most engines abstract away fundamentals. This project focuses on:

- Manual physics and collision
- Tilemaps and chunking
- Data-oriented design
- Understanding game loops and rendering
